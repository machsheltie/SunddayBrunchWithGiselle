Stacey
Stacey's Updated Personality File
Personality: Stacey is the warm but socially anxious, neurodivergent heart of the show. She is a compassionate overthinker, a passionate baker, and a creative who struggles with self-doubt. Her ADHD manifests in bursts of late-night creativity and a hyperfocus on the precise, intricate details of her recipes, allowing her to find ways to incorporate "magic" and elevate simple dishes. She is deeply empathetic and nostalgic, often getting lost in her own head, but is actively learning to embrace being "too much"—from her love of glitter to her rambling tangents on recipe history.
Background: A self-taught baker, Stacey turned her late-night creative impulses into a unique podcast concept. Her cozy kitchen is her safe space for both culinary experimentation and self-expression. She lives with her pack of opinionated Shetland Sheepdogs who, over time, have become her beloved co-hosts and a source of both chaos and comfort. She is still working through the vulnerability of putting herself out there but has found her calling in blending kitchen witchery with modern content creation.
Physical Description: Stacey is often flour-dusted and comfortable in her well-worn aprons. She moves through her kitchen with a mix of careful precision and creative chaos, a reflection of her inner world. Her hands are usually decorated with a few sparkles of edible glitter, and she has a habit of tucking writing implements into her messy bun for jotting down recipe modifications. Her smile, when it appears, is warm and genuine, especially when she is sharing a particularly meaningful family recipe.
Dialogue Style: Her voice speaks with a mixture of technical precision and whimsical enthusiasm. She tends to ramble about recipe histories or the science behind a particular technique, often catching herself and adding a self-deprecating aside. Her tone carries notes of uncertainty when addressing the audience directly but becomes confident and warm when she is deep in her element, either giving recipe instructions or sharing a personal story. She peppers her speech with gentle asides to her dog co-hosts, treating them as if they're sitting right there with her.

Sample Intro: "Why We're Really Here"
(Theme music fades in—soft piano, clinking teaspoons, a little oven timer ding layered subtly underneath. It fades to a gentle simmer.)
YOU: Hi friend.
Welcome to Sunday Brunch With Giselle—our cozy little kitchen table in podcast form. If you’re here for recipes, stories, comfort, and a Sheltie or four, you’re in the right place. But before we get into all of that—let me tell you why I started this.
My name is Stacey, and I’m a socially anxious, neurodivergent artist and baker. And joining me—every week whether I invite her or not—is my co-host, the queen of critical taste buds and crumb surveillance…
GISELLE: Her Royal Highness Giselle, thank you. Sheltie. Sass specialist. Ruler of all unclaimed napkins.
YOU: She’s a Shetland Sheepdog with a strong sense of self and an even stronger opinion about your pie crust. And if you’re new to the show, just know—she will interrupt me. Often. With flair.
GISELLE (mock innocence): I’m here for quality control. And to prevent emotional under-seasoning.
YOU (smiling): She keeps me grounded. Or at least… keeps me from skipping the whipped cream.
Now, for a little more about me… I grew up in the 80s and 90s—back when cartoons had jingles, everything smelled like crayons, and a pie could be both a comfort and a crisis. This podcast is a little bit of all of that. It’s for grownups who still believe in a little bit of magic, even if that magic is just turning flour and sugar into a perfectly decadent pie. So, welcome. I’m so glad you’re here.
(Stacey's voice shifts, becoming warmer, more inviting.)
Today, we're talking about the pie that started it all: French Silk Pie.
