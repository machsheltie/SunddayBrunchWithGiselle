Podcast Concept: Sunday Brunch With Giselle
Tagline: A little whimsy, a lot of warmth, and just enough wagging tails—for grownups who still believe in magic (and know a pie can be both therapy and threat).

? OVERVIEW
Sunday Brunch With Giselle is a cozy, story-rich baking podcast hosted by Stacey—a warm, witty home baker and artist—and co-hosted by her regal Shetland Sheepdog, Giselle. It is set in a kitchen that feels like a refuge from the outside world, blending nostalgic storytelling, creative baking, and whimsical Sheltie character banter into a charming weekly escape for millennial and Gen X adults craving softness, sensory joy, and a sense of belonging. The show is built on recurring motifs: the kitchen as a sanctuary; food as a language of love and emotion; and the Shelties as a microcosm of humanity.
Inspired by Shari Lewis & Lamb Chop, The Pioneer Woman, Smitten Kitchen, and Bravetart, the show mixes heartfelt personal stories, well-tested heirloom recipes, and a cast of canine characters with full personalities and distinct voices.
