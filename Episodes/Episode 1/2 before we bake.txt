The Kitchen Check-In (Your Signature Opening Ritual)
STACEY: Before we dive into today's magic, let me paint you a picture of what's happening in this kitchen right now.
Phaedra is curled up next to the oven vent like a philosopher-in-residence, probably contemplating the molecular structure of butter or something equally profound.
Havok has knocked a mixing bowl off the counter and is looking at me like I did it. The audacity of that bowl, really, jumping to its own demise.
HAVOK: [defensive, from across the kitchen] That was clearly a tactical assessment of gravitational forces!
STACEY: Of course it was. Tiana just walked away in quiet disapproval after sniffing the butter—apparently it doesn't meet her standards for sparkle content.
TIANA: [distant, dramatic] It smells like... potential! But not enough jazz!
STACEY: And Giselle? Giselle is pacing like we're behind schedule and she has a diplomatic luncheon at noon.
GISELLE: It's not pacing, it's managing. There's a difference. One involves purpose, the other involves aimless wandering. I don't wander.
STACEY: [laughing] Of course not. Heaven forbid we suggest the Queen of Quality Control might be anything less than strategically positioned.
GISELLE: Exactly. And while we're on the subject, that vanilla extract has been sitting open for exactly four minutes and thirty-seven seconds. The aromatics are dissipating.
STACEY: You don't actually have a stopwatch, Giselle.
GISELLE: I have an internal chronometer calibrated for optimal baking conditions. It's very precise.
STACEY: [to listeners] This is my life, friends. Beautiful, chaotic, and overseen by a furry supervisor who takes her job very seriously.
The kitchen smells like possibility right now—that clean flour scent, the richness of real vanilla hanging in the air, and just a hint of yesterday's cinnamon rolls still lingering. It's warm in here, not just from the oven but from something harder to name. Safety, maybe. The feeling that in this one space, we can take our time and make something beautiful.
I've got my ingredients lined up like little soldiers—butter at the perfect room temperature, eggs that I pulled from the fridge an hour ago, and chocolate that's about to become the star of our show. There's something deeply satisfying about this moment, right before we begin. When everything is measured and ready, and the only thing left is the magic of transformation.
GISELLE: Speaking of transformation, that butter has been sitting out for exactly sixty-three minutes. I've been monitoring the situation.
STACEY: Of course you have. And your professional assessment?
GISELLE: Adequate. Though I question your decision to use a glass mixing bowl when clearly the ceramic one provides superior acoustics for whipping.
STACEY: [laughing] I'll make a note for next time. "Giselle prefers ceramic for optimal sound quality during egg whipping."
GISELLE: Finally, someone who takes notes. Now, are we going to discuss kitchen equipment all morning, or are we going to create chocolate silk that would make the French weep with envy?
STACEY: [grinning] Right. Let's make some magic, shall we? But first, let me tell you why this particular pie means everything to me.

Production Notes:
    • Maintains your established character dynamics 
    • Gives Giselle multiple comedy beats throughout 
    • Includes sensory worldbuilding details 
    • Natural transition into your story segment 
    • Timing should hit 2:45-3:00 with proper pacing 
    • Other Shelties get brief moments but Giselle dominates as your comedy partner
