## Workflow: Clone from Movie/Reference Audio

### Step 1: Gather Reference Audio
For each character, find clean audio clips (10-30 seconds minimum):

**Giselle - Goldie Hawn in Overboard**
- Find clips of her posh, playful dialogue
- Look for moments with her signature breathiness and warmth
- Aim for 30-60 seconds total of clean audio

**Phaedra - Tara Strong as Twilight Sparkle**
- Find clips of warm, educational, curious dialogue
- Moments of excitement about discoveries

**Tiana - Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood**
- Dreamy, ethereal, joyful moments
- Whimsical, wonder-filled dialogue

**Havok - Steve Martin/Bill Murray (military comedy)**
- Theatrical, over-the-top delivery
- Comedic timing, dramatic moments

### Step 2: Create Voice Clones in PlayHT
1. Upload reference audio for each character
2. PlayHT analyzes and creates voice profile
3. Name each profile (Giselle, Phaedra, Tiana, Havok)
4. Test with sample lines to verify quality

### Step 3: Generate Dialogue with Emotion Tags
For each line, specify:
- **Text:** The dialogue
- **Emotion:** happy, sad, angry, excited, sassy, mischievous, calm, etc.
- **Intensity:** Slider (subtle to extreme)
- **Pitch/Speed:** Fine-tune adjustments
- **Emphasis:** Which words to stress

**Example - Giselle:**
```
Text: "Oh, THAT'S your technique? How... quaint."
Emotion: sassy
Intensity: 70%
Emphasis: THAT'S, quaint
Pitch: +5% (for condescension)
Speed: 0.95x (for deliberate delivery)
```

**Example - Havok:**
```
Text: "MISSION CRITICAL! The chocolate is approaching DEFCON 1!"
Emotion: dramatic
Intensity: 90%
Emphasis: MISSION CRITICAL, DEFCON 1
Speed: 1.2x (for urgency)
```

### Step 4: Export and Import to Audacity
- Generate all character lines
- Export high-quality audio files
- Import to respective tracks in Audacity template
- Mix with music and sound effects
