Sunday Brunch With Giselle - Official Intro Script
Target: 90-95 seconds [Soft, warm music with gentle kitchen sounds - teaspoon clinking, distant oven timer]
STACEY: Hi friend. Welcome to Sunday Brunch With Giselle—where the pies are decadent, the stories matter, and my co-hosts have four paws and zero filter about your baking choices.
I'm Stacey—neurodivergent artist and baker who grew up on Lamb Chop and still believes weekends can feel like magic. Joining me today, whether I invite her or not...
GISELLE: [interrupting regally] Her Royal Highness. Giselle. Sheltie. Sass specialist. Ruler of all unclaimed napkins and inadequate pie crusts.
HAVOK: [bursting in, military style] This is Havok reporting live from Kitchen Base Alpha! Current mission status: Operation Chocolate Paradise is go!
TIANA: [bubbly, excited] I'm Tiana! Oh! Oh! Are we doing the pie today? The magical, sparkly, makes-your-soul-happy pie?
PHAEDRA: [gentle wisdom] And I'm Phaedra. I'm here to remind us that every recipe teaches us something about patience and love.
STACEY: [laughing] And this is exactly why I love Sunday morning kitchen magic. As you can tell, my co-hosts have... thoughts about everything.
Today we're making French Silk Pie, and trust me, by the time we're done, you'll understand why this isn't just dessert—it's a declaration. A delicious, ridiculously rich declaration that you deserve good things, and so do the people you choose to share them with.
The oven's warming to 350, I've got vanilla extract open on the counter—that first whiff always feels like possibility—and Giselle's already positioned herself for optimal crumb surveillance.
Ready to make some magic?

PRODUCTION NOTES:
    • Template format: Replace "French Silk Pie" and related description with each episode's featured recipe 
    • "Operation Chocolate Paradise" in Havok's line should be customized to match the recipe theme 
    • Tiana's excited preview should reference the specific bake 
    • Maintain consistent character voices and timing 
    • Sensory kitchen details can be adjusted based on recipe requirements (oven temp, key ingredients)
