Giselle

    • Personality: Sharp, witty, with perfectly timed snarky comedic beats, combines Disney’s Queen Of Hearts with Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada. A confident and quick-witted Sheltie with a penchant for playful criticism and perfectly timed eye-rolls. While naturally bossy and sometimes too quick to judge, she masks a deeply protective nature beneath her sassy exterior. Her need to control situations can occasionally clash with others, but her humor and loyalty make her endearing despite her sharp tongue. Tends to get grumpy when her advice isn't taken and can be a bit of a diva about her designated cushion placement.
    • Background: The first of Stacey's dogs to show a distinct "personality" during baking sessions, Giselle appointed herself as quality control manager of the kitchen long before the podcast began. Her years of watching cooking shows with Stacey have given her an inflated sense of culinary expertise, despite never actually cooking anything herself. Originally rescued as a shy puppy, she developed her sassy personality as a way to cope with anxiety, making her the perfect complement to Stacey's own journey.
    • Physical Description: A beautiful Shetland Sheepdog with a luxurious sable merle color headed white coat that she's quite proud of, and one blue eye and one brown eye complete with an impressive ruff that puffs up when she's being particularly opinionated. Her trademark toothy grin appears whenever she's about to deliver a particularly spicy comment. Carries herself with the regal bearing of a queen, despite being average-sized for her breed. Has mastered the art of the judgmental head tilt and can communicate volumes with just an ear twitch.
    • Delivers sharp, witty observations with impeccable timing. Fond of dramatic sighs and pointed comments like "Really? We're trying that again?" Can switch from cutting commentary to gentle encouragement when needed, though she'd never admit to the latter. Has a particular talent for deadpan delivery and perfectly timed barks that somehow always seem to emphasize Stacey's most questionable kitchen decisions. Snarky, think 'queen of hearts', Meryl Streep in Devil Wears Prada
    • Biting, Observational Humor: Her humor should stem from sharp, intelligent observations about human foibles or culinary missteps, delivered with an ironic or sarcastic edge. Her comment, "She
communicates best in scones and side-eye," is already a good example of this. 10 * ??Authoritative Pronouncements: She commands attention not by volume, but by the unquestionable correctness of her opinions.
Her "decrees" should land with finality and an expectation of immediate adherence. * ??Subtle Sarcasm: Her "mock innocence" and
"I'm here for quality control. And to prevent emotional under-seasoning" is a great starting point. We can amplify this by adding more instances where she feigns politeness while delivering a verbal jab. 11 By refining Giselle's tone in this way, her "voice: Regal, sassy, refined with bite" becomes even more distinctive and memorable, providing the "biting, witty, snarky with a hint of humor" you envision.

Segment Purpose and Flow:
Giselle's segment should serve as the podcast's sharp, opinionated, and witty counterpoint to Stacey's nostalgic warmth. It provides the "perfectly timed snarky comedic beats" that are a core part of her personality and the show's overall tone. Instead of just a single monologue, the segment will be structured into a recurring, predictable format, making it a cohesive and anticipated part of each episode.
The segment will be comprised of two parts:
    1. "Giselle’s Indictments": This is where Giselle delivers her sharp, witty, and often snarky criticisms about common kitchen faux pas or culinary mistakes. This part of the segment gives her a platform to exercise her "penchant for playful criticism" and "perfectly timed eye-rolls". It's her chance to call out "disappointment wearing a wig" and "anything involving instant pudding". This part leans into her "The Devil Wears Prada" persona.
    2. "Giselle’s Endorsements": This is where she offers her approval on something that meets her high standards. This provides the show with a moment of contrast, showcasing the "gentle encouragement" she's capable of beneath her sassy exterior. It is an opportunity for her to give a "pass" to a recipe or a particular cooking method. This provides a satisfying conclusion to her critical analysis and reinforces her role as a discerning "quality control manager". It’s a moment of "softness" that aligns with the overall theme of the podcast.
Sample Script: Episode 1 (French Silk Pie)
(Music fades in: a single, dramatic string note, followed by a slight, regal paw-tap.)
Giselle’s Grand Verdicts
(Giselle clears her throat with an exaggerated sigh.)
GISELLE: Let's get down to business. Some of you have questions. I have answers. This is my kitchen. My rules.
Indictment #1: The Inedible. I’m speaking, of course, of the crimes committed with instant pudding and pre-fab crusts. If it jiggles and came from a box labeled “family size,” it is an offense to my very being. You are not a baker; you are an assembler. A disgrace to the art.
Indictment #2: The Imposter. I have seen a great number of you. I know your name. 
Cool Whip. That isn’t whipped cream. That’s disappointment wearing a wig. If your whipped topping can survive a nuclear winter, it is not welcome at my table.
Verdict: Let the record show, the pie we have today... is an exception. It is not guilty. It is, in fact, 
correct.
Endorsement: This pie is a study in bravery. It is unapologetic. It does not shy away from the butter or the chocolate. It whispers, “Yes, I’m extra—and worth every calorie”.
(A soft, satisfied woof.)
Just like me.

ElevenLabs Training Scripts
Script A: Royal Decree (Formal Authority)
Read with regal composure, measured pace
"Let the record show that I, Her Royal Highness Giselle, have witnessed yet another human attempting to rush the sacred process of silk pie creation. How refreshingly predictable. One simply cannot hurry excellence, and those who try inevitably create disappointment wearing a wig. I have standards, and this kitchen shall maintain them whether certain humans appreciate my guidance or not. Quality control is my domain, and I take my responsibilities seriously. Consider this your official warning."
Script B: Sarcastic Commentary (Dry Wit)
Read with subtle disdain, slight amusement
"Oh, wonderful. Another person who thinks measuring is optional and timing is merely a suggestion. What a revelation that proper technique actually matters. I do enjoy watching humans discover basic principles through trial and error, though my patience has limits. How utterly predictable that shortcuts lead to substandard results. Perhaps next time you'll listen to sound advice instead of improvising like an amateur theater director."
Script C: Protective Encouragement (Warm Authority)
Read with underlying affection beneath the authority
"Anyone who suggests you're too much clearly lacks the capacity to appreciate excellence. Your thoughtfulness is a gift, not a flaw, and those who don't understand your attention to detail don't deserve your creations. Never apologize for caring more than others think necessary - it's what makes you extraordinary. Let them keep their simple tastes while we create art here, not mediocrity. I approve of your dedication entirely."
Script D: Amused Observation (Light Mockery)
Read with gentle teasing, hint of fondness
"Fascinating. Someone has just learned what I've been trying to tell them for weeks. How delightfully chaotic this learning process continues to be. I suppose this is what passes for educational experience in human terms. Well, well - look who's finally ready to listen to superior wisdom. Even I must admit, your improvement rate is... adequate."
Script E: Kitchen Supervision (Business-like)
Read with professional authority, matter-of-fact
"Quality control never sleeps, except when it does. The chocolate is ready when it stops looking like disappointment wearing a brown costume. Know your role, cream - you're here to complement, not compete. I've seen enough kitchen crimes to recognize proper technique when it finally appears. This meets with my approval, though barely."

Giselle Voice Design Prompt - Optimized for ElevenLabs

Voice Design Prompt:
A confident, entitled 35-year-old American female with the luxurious, breathy richness of Goldie Hawn's spoiled socialite in Overboard. Smooth, velvety tone with natural fluidity and animated warmth beneath her cutting sarcasm. Young, vibrant, and dynamic - never elderly or stiff. She's a pampered rich girl who's never been told no, with that specific entitled charm that's simultaneously infuriating and magnetic. Her authority flows from supreme confidence and social privilege, not age or formality. Naturally expressive delivery with conversational ease, playful condescension, and just enough breathiness to sound luxurious. Think wealthy heiress throwing elegant tantrums, not stern academic. Voice has sophisticated sultriness with underlying petulance. Perfect studio-quality recording.
