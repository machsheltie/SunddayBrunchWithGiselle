# Visual Assets Brief

## 1. Podcast Cover Art
**Goal:** A square image (3000 x 3000 px ideal, but standard ratio for generation) that captures the cozy, whimsical nature of the show.

**Elements:**
- **Stacey:** A woman with a warm smile, perhaps holding a whisk or a mug.
- **Giselle:** A Sheltie (Shetland Sheepdog) looking regal or mischievous, perhaps wearing a small accessory (like a bandana or a tiny crown, though keep it subtle).
- **Setting:** A cozy kitchen table, sunlight streaming in, baking ingredients scattered artfully.
- **Text:** "Sunday Brunch With Giselle" (Legible, integrated).

**AI Image Prompt Idea:**
> A warm, cozy, watercolor-style illustration for a podcast cover. A friendly woman with messy bun holding a steaming mug sits at a rustic wooden kitchen table. Next to her is a fluffy, regal Shetland Sheepdog (Sheltie) looking at a plate of pastries. Soft sunlight, sage green and buttercream yellow color palette. Text "Sunday Brunch With Giselle" in whimsical script at the top. High quality, storybook aesthetic.

## 2. Giselle Character Portrait
