The Pie That Started a Dynasty - Enhanced Story Segment
Target: 5-8 minutes Story Segment
STACEY: The first time I made this pie, it wasn't about dessert.
It was about survival.
It was about language when I didn't have the words.
It was about walking into someone else's family's Thanksgiving and trying—so desperately—to not just be tolerated… but liked.
I was dating someone at the time. He invited me to Thanksgiving with his family, and I said yes with what I hoped was a confident smile. But inside? Inside, I was already calculating escape routes.
What I didn't realize yet was just how overwhelming it would be. His family was big. Loud. Spirited in a way I wasn't prepared for. They were the type who laugh over each other, yell across rooms, toss teasing insults over green bean casserole and turkey legs like it's an Olympic sport.
They were lovely people… but they were not quiet people. And quiet was all I knew how to be.
GISELLE: [observational] Some families communicate in volume. Others communicate in thoughtfulness. Neither is wrong, but they don't always translate well.
STACEY: Exactly, Giselle. And I—well, I was never going to charm them with small talk. I have social anxiety. I'm soft-spoken. I freeze in large groups like a deer in headlights. I forget punchlines halfway through telling them. I lose words when I need them most.
You know that feeling when you're in a room full of people, and everyone else seems to have received some social instruction manual you never got? That was me at every gathering.
So instead of trying to talk my way in… I decided to bake my way in.
GISELLE: [approvingly] A classic power move. Make them kneel with chocolate.
STACEY: [laughing] I love how your mind works. I wanted to bring something that would say all the things I couldn't. Something that would walk into that kitchen ahead of me and announce, "She may be quiet, but she's thoughtful. She made this for you. She cares."
So I started researching recipes with the intensity of someone preparing for a doctoral defense. Cookbooks spread across my kitchen table, printed recipes covering every surface, comparison charts and pros-cons lists everywhere.
GISELLE: [dryly] Because normal people simply choose a recipe and bake it. How refreshingly uncomplicated.
STACEY: [to listeners] Giselle understands my particular brand of overthinking. I didn't want anything simple or average. I wanted impressive. A showstopper. Something that spoke fluent "I'm worth getting to know."
That's when I found French Silk Pie.
Even the name whispered elegance. Chocolate. Silk. Drama. It sounded like something you'd order at a restaurant where they bring you tiny spoons and use words like "decadent" unironically.
I tested five different recipes, lined them up like suspects on a corkboard with notes scribbled in margins like a dessert detective.
When you've got ADHD and anxiety, "good enough" is never enough. Especially when everything feels on the line.
I whipped batch after batch. Too soft. Too grainy. Too dense. Too runny. The kitchen smelled like vanilla and determination.
I wrote in margins like a scientist documenting experiments: "Whip butter and sugar longer." "Use pasteurized eggs."
"Beat eggs longer—20 minutes total." "Needs more butter."
Counters dusted with powdered sugar, sink overflowing with mixing bowls. Giselle watched from her bed, wondering why her human had lost her mind over chocolate.
GISELLE: [reminiscing] That week was... educational. The kitchen smelled perpetually of chocolate, and someone was muttering about "silk texture" at all hours.
STACEY: Eventually, after what felt like a PhD program in pie making, I landed on a recipe that felt like a spell. Glossy. Light. Rich. Structured, but silky. When I tasted it, I actually said "Oh!" out loud, like I'd discovered something precious.
I felt proud of it. Like I'd finally translated something unspoken into a dessert. Like I'd found my voice, and it spoke fluent chocolate.
This pie was going to carry me across that awkward holiday table like a diplomat with whipped cream diplomacy.
So the day before Thanksgiving, I baked. I whipped. I garnished with chocolate curls that I'd practiced making until they looked like tiny works of art. I even said a little prayer to Mary Berry, because if you're going to invoke anyone for baking success, it might as well be royalty.
I carried that pie into their house like it was a holy relic. Like it contained all my hopes for acceptance wrapped in a buttery crust.
Their kitchen was beautiful chaos—kids weaving between adults, cousins arguing over football games, casseroles competing for oven space. The whole house hummed with the kind of easy intimacy that comes from years of shared holidays.
No one really noticed me slip in with my carefully transported masterpiece. But they noticed the pie.
And then… dinner ended. Dessert time arrived.
Someone took a bite of my pie. I watched them chew, waiting for their face to light up with recognition of the magic I'd created. They tilted their head, gave a polite smile, and said…
"It's… a bit rich."
[long pause]
STACEY: [softly] And in that moment, I felt like I'd been cracked open.
Because that pie was me.
That pie was all the things I couldn't say. All the care I'd put into choosing the perfect recipe, the hours of testing, the hope I'd folded into every layer. That pie was the part of myself I wanted so badly to offer—the thoughtful, creative, maybe-a-little-too-intense part that tries to show love through attention to detail.
And it was… "too rich."
[pause]
I smiled and nodded and said something like "Oh, it's definitely decadent," but inside, I was shrinking. Because if my pie was too much, then maybe I was too much. Maybe my way of caring was too intense, too extra, too… me.
GISELLE: [low, protective] Name names.
STACEY: [chuckling despite herself] No, Giselle. But I appreciate your loyalty.
That comment stayed with me, though. It curled up in the soft part of my stomach and made itself a home for a while. Every time I thought about making something special for someone, I'd hear that voice: "It's a bit rich." Translation: "You're a bit much."
It wasn't until much later—years later, actually—that I realized something important.
They weren't my people.
Not because they didn't like the pie. People have different tastes, different preferences. That's not the problem.
The problem was that they didn't see the gift in it. They didn't see the love language I was speaking. They saw excess where I saw abundance. They saw "too much" where I saw "just enough care."
GISELLE: [with quiet authority] The right people see thoughtfulness where others see extravagance. It's a matter of recognition, not worth.
STACEY: Exactly. And this pie? This "too rich" pie became my signature. It became the dessert people request for their birthdays. It's been served at celebrations and comfort dinners, at holidays where the people around the table did see me—really see me.
I've brought this pie to friends going through breakups, to new neighbors, to potlucks where someone always asks for the recipe. I've made it for people who understand that when someone spends hours creating something beautiful for you, the appropriate response isn't "it's a bit much"—it's "thank you."
This pie taught me that there's nothing wrong with being rich. In flavor, in feeling, in the fullness of how you show up in the world.
Some people prefer simple. Vanilla. Understated. And that's perfectly fine.
But some of us? Some of us are French Silk Pie people. We're complex and layered and maybe a little dramatic, and we show love through attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile.
This pie is not for everyone.
But it is absolutely, completely, perfectly for the ones who get it. For the ones who taste thoughtfulness and say "more, please." For the ones who understand that "too much" is often exactly enough.
GISELLE: [with finality] And those are the only people worth baking for anyway.
STACEY: [warmly] Couldn't have said it better myself, Your Majesty.
