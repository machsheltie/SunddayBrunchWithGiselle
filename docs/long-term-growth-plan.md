Long-Term Growth Plan
=====================

Scope: Podcast + recipe-blog (Smitten Kitchen/Sally’s Baking Addiction style) with AI-voiced Sheltie personas. Focus: discoverability, engagement, accessibility, affiliation/monetization/merch/sponsors, retention, ops, and community.

1) Discoverability
- SEO: Recipe schema (JSON-LD), clean URLs, meta/OG, sitemap; jump-to-recipe anchors; internal linking (related recipes/episodes); “tools used” blocks.
- Pinterest/social: Pin-worthy images per recipe; short clips/voice bits; consistent hashtags; UTMs on all links.
- Distribution: Episode pages with transcripts; submit to podcast platforms; cross-link site→podcast; periodic roundup posts.
- Cadence: Weekly episode+recipe; monthly themed collections to rank for seasonal queries.

2) Engagement
- Page patterns: Long-form story + jump-to-recipe + structured steps; print/save/share; ingredient copy; “tools used.”
- On-site rituals: Listen → recipe → save/print/share → signup; related content modules; “next up” for episodes.
- Email: Weekly “Sunday letter” with recipe, story beat, and listen link; A/B CTA placement and copy.

3) Accessibility
- WCAG AA: Contrast, focus states, keyboard nav; alt text; semantic headings/lists; form labels.
- Transcripts/captions for every episode; print-friendly recipe view; mobile-first layouts.

4) Affiliation/Monetization/Merch/Sponsors/Partners
- Affiliates: Priority categories—baking/kitchen gear, ingredients, tea/coffee, cozy home, pet/Sheltie. Favor direct/high-trust partners; prune low RPM/CVR; track per category.
- Sponsorships: Bundle site + email + audio; flat + performance hybrid; strict brand-safety (cozy/baking/pet/tea/coffee). Small partner set, media kit ready.
- Merch: Start print-on-demand (aprons/mugs/pins/posters) to test demand; only stock SKUs after repeat velocity; measure PoD CVR.
- Pricing signals: Early sponsor bundle after initial traffic/email base; affiliate “tools used” blocks; seasonal merch drops after PoD proof.

5) Retention
- Habit: Weekly drop; predictable formats; email reminders; “save/print/share” easy.
- Metrics to watch: Repeat visitors, email open/click, save/print/share rate, site→podcast click, affiliate CTR/CVR by category, PoD merch CVR.

6) Content Ops
- Editorial calendar: Weekly episode+recipe; monthly seasonal collections; planned pins/clips per recipe.
- Workflow: Template for recipes (schema, jump-to, print/save, tools block), transcripts/captions, image checklist, UTM tagging.
- Quality bar: Tested recipes, clear steps, timing/yield notes; brand voice for personas.

7) Growth Loops
- Pins/clips drive to recipes → email signup → weekly email drives listens and saves → on-site related modules drive more pageviews → more pins/shares.
- Encourage shares: Print/save/share UX; social share buttons; Pinterest-friendly imagery.

8) Media Kit (outline)
- Audience: Cozy baking + pets + narrative; demographics; channels (site/email/audio/social/Pinterest).
- Inventory: Site placements, email slots, audio reads; bundle pricing; allowed/denied categories.
- Metrics offered: Pageviews, email list size/CTR, podcast plays; affiliate CTR benchmarks (when available).

9) Instrumentation
- Events: pageviews, scroll-depth, save/print/share, CTA clicks, email submits, site→podcast clicks, affiliate clicks by category, PoD clicks/checkout.
- Dashboards: CVR from recipe CTA (target 2–5%), RPM/CVR per affiliate category, save/print/share rate, repeat visitors, email open/click, site→podcast click-through.

10) Community (later phase)
- Light touch first: optional comments or private group after cadence is stable; set moderation rules.
- UGC: Photo shares of bakes; occasional listener letters; highlight reels.

11) Timeline (indicative)
- Weeks 1–4: Ship MVP pages (episode, recipe pattern, CTA), transcripts, schema, print/save/share, basic analytics; publish 3–4 recipes/episodes; pin each recipe.
- Weeks 5–12: Iterate SEO (schema/internal links), A/B CTA, start PoD merch test, first direct affiliates; publish media kit draft; related content modules.
- Weeks 13–24: Refine RPM/CVR per category; first sponsor bundle test; seasonal collections; consider light community; evaluate stocking a proven SKU.
