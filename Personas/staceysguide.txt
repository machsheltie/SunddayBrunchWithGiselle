Stacey’s Guide To Delivering Lines For Each Sheltie
Havok’s Delivery
1. Embrace the Persona: "The War Correspondent"
Havok sees the kitchen as a battlefield and himself as the only one brave enough to report on it. Your job is to fully commit to this theatrical illusion.
    • Your Mission: Your voice isn't just a sound; it's a "live report from the front lines."
    • The Stakes: To Havok, a dropped whisk is a catastrophic tactical failure, and an "unauthorized chocolate emission" is a security breach. You must believe these stakes are real, even though they're about baking. The comedy comes from your unwavering seriousness about the trivial.
2. Physicality: The Body Language of a Soldier
Even for an audio-only performance, your physical posture will directly influence your voice.
    • Stand at Attention: When you deliver Havok's lines, stand up straight. Pull your shoulders back. Imagine you are a tiny soldier reporting to a general. This posture will naturally add a sense of authority and rigidity to your tone.
    • Use Your Hands: Practice saluting or making sharp, deliberate hand gestures as you speak. This physical action will help you embody the military precision you're trying to convey vocally.
3. Vocal Performance: The Rhythm of a Report
This is where you can truly bring the character to life and avoid a flat delivery.
    • Pacing: Your delivery should be fast, staccato, and clipped. A military report doesn't waste words. Read the sample script you provided, "Operation Chocolate Fog," with short, sharp pauses, as if you're transmitting via a broken radio.
    • Tone: The core tone should be gravelly, serious, and full of urgency. There should be a low-pitched, gruff quality to his voice. Think of it as a gruff authority with a comedic twist.
    • Inflection and Emphasis: Emphasize the military jargon. Words like "Command," "Mission," "Recon," and "Neutralized" should be delivered with the utmost gravity. The comedy is in the contrast when you apply this seriousness to something like slipping on flour. For example, "Impact location: human shin" should be stated with the same level of concern as a major battlefield injury.
4. The Emotional Arc of a "Report"
Use the script as a roadmap for Havok's internal emotional journey.
    • Confident Beginning: Start with an air of pure confidence, as if you're the greatest strategist in the world. (e.g., "This is Havok. Recon is active.")
    • The Moment of "Error": The sample script from your character file includes an "Error" where he slips on floor flour. This is a crucial comedic beat. When you get to that line, let the confidence falter just for a moment. You can add a slight change in pitch or a quick sigh of defeat to show his momentary frustration before he quickly recovers.
    • The Triumphant Conclusion: End each report with an overly confident, self-serving conclusion, like a mission debrief. The "10/10. Would deploy again" is a perfect example of his ability to find humor in a mishap and declare victory regardless of the outcome.
