Don’t mind me… just a little whimsical fun ?
A while back, I was thinking about how I wished I had taken advantage of creating a recipe blog back before most of the successful ones moved to TikTok. I was wistfully thinking about what I would’ve done with said blog and as my ADHD brain likes to do, it wanders and scales and dives down the rabbit hole until we have… this. Sunday Brunch With Giselle-  a podcast with recipe blog, as well as all of the other types of social media, though those are less fleshed out as of now. I have a promo description for it and overview and even have a little sample script that I’ve been tinkering with.
This was created in a fun little night of high energy, no sleep and way too much caffeine… and I decided to run with it.

Sunday Brunch With Giselle
A little whimsy, a lot of warmth, and just enough wagging tails—for grownups who still believe in magic (and know a pie can be both therapy and threat).

Welcome to Sunday Brunch With Giselle, the storytelling baking show where the pies are decadent, the commentary is snarky, and the co-host has four paws and no filter. 

Each week, host Stacey—artist, nostalgic home baker, and socially anxious kitchen witch—invites you into her cozy corner of the world—a sun-drenched kitchen filled with the sounds of whisks, kettle whistles, and gentle Sheltie paw taps—for a little baking alchemy. It's proof that the smallest tweaks can turn sugar and flour into something extraordinary. 

And she’s not alone. She’s joined by her hilariously opinionated Sheltie cohost, Giselle, who delivers bite-sized sass with a toothy grin—and a full supporting cast of fluffy four-legged personalities: 

    • Giselle – The Queen of critical taste buds, with a royal decree for every culinary crime.
    • Havok – The self-appointed war correspondent, delivering comedic, military-style updates from the front lines of the kitchen.
    • Tiana – The joyful taster, whose exuberant, hyper-specific notes celebrate the pure magic of food.
    • Phaedra – The soft-spoken science dogter™, who finds heartfelt philosophical truths in every precise measurement.

…What you’ll find here? Think real, cozy recipes you can actually make, woven together with stories about belonging, bravery, and learning to be “too much” in the best way. Along the way, you’ll hear commentary that swings from poetic to downright unhinged, plus segments from Giselle and her Sheltie siblings—chaotic mission reports, dramatic critiques, a little heartfelt science, and more than a touch of gentle wisdom. At its heart, this show is a home for the neurodivergent, the nostalgic, and anyone soft-hearted enough to enjoy their coziness with a sparkle of sarcasm.

 It’s Lamb Chop for grownups—with better snacks, more glitter, and Shelties who talk back.
